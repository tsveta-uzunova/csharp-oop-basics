# C# OOP Basics 

### Project 01.CarManufacturer

The provided C# program, part of an object-oriented programming exercise within the CarManufacturer namespace, introduces a Car class with public properties, encompassing make, model, year, fuel quantity, and fuel consumption. The exercise focuses on constructing flexible initialization options for Car objects through various constructors. Engine and Tire classes also enhance the Car class, further exemplifying object-oriented principles.

### Project 02.Students

This object-oriented programming exercise creates a program to sort students by their grades in descending order. The program involves a class named "Student" that encapsulates the details of each student, including their first name, last name, and grade. The user inputs the count of students and their information, and the program outputs the sorted details based on grades.

### Project 03.Articles

In this object-oriented exercise, a class named "Article" is created with properties for title, content, and author. The class includes methods to edit the content, change the author, and rename the article. Additionally, the class overrides the ToString method to display the article details in a specific format. The program reads an article's initial state and a series of commands to modify it. In the end, the program prints the final state of the article.

### Project 04.Teamwork Projects 

In this object-oriented programming exercise project, a " Team " class is created to manage teamwork projects. The class handles the registration of teams, team creation, and user participation. Teams are printed with their members sorted by count and name. Various rules are enforced, such as preventing duplicate team creation by a user, restricting a team creator from forming another team, and disbanding teams with zero members. The final output displays valid teams ordered by name with their members.

### Project 05.Pokemon Trainer 

This object-oriented exercise involves creating classes for "Trainer" and "Pokemon." Trainers start with 0 badges and have a collection of Pokemon, while Pokemon have a name, element, and health. The program processes tournament commands, updating trainer collections based on elements. Trainers earn badges or lose Pokemon health. The final output displays trainers sorted by badge count, with ties resolved by input order.
